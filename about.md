My name is Steven and I'm the Software Development Manager for a Shreveport based software consulting company named [Praeses](http://www.praeses.com).  I am interested in how to best solve the needs of my clients through the use technology and business process re-engineering with a slant towards automation.

I'm a web developer at heart and enjoy programming with [Microsoft ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) and Entity Framework on the .NET Framework, but am starting to open myself up to new open source technologies not on the Microsoft stack.

I'm a father of one and husband to a wonderful woman who keeps me grounded and continuously moving forward.  I try to keep a good home/work life balance and believe that working more hours doesn't necessarily mean you get more done.  Work smarter not harder, and always let your brain rest when it needs to.

Thanks for reading!
